SmallFS

Q: What is SmallFS ?
A: SmallFS is a very low-overhead filesystem intended for small embedded
   systems. It's very suitable to use on memory or sequencial devices, like
   flash systems.

Q: What are SmallFS limitations ?
A: SmallFS only supports one directory, and regular files. Files are limited
   to 4Gb in size. The whole filesystem is also limited to 4Gb.

Q: How is SmallFS laid out ?
A: SmallFS includes a 8-byte header, a root directory and the files 
   themselves. Each directory entry uses 9 bytes plus the file name.
   All files can be easily accessed by using a simple offset to start of
   filesystem.
